Java-Enabled Filesystem Explorer

My attempt at making a file manager in Java.

### Main Objective
To provide an easy and intuitive way to perform file searches, with literals and regex alike. That was my main
gripe with Nautilus (see below) and the feature I set out to fix.

Secondary goals:

* Integration with keyring software (Kassandra etc.) for crypto-related tasks
* Bulk file operations. Why isn't this an out-of-the-box feature with every FM? Perhaps I'll find out.
* FTP sessions. Every other aftermarket manager does this, so should jefe.
* Integrated hex viewer, simple file editor etc. If I have time.
* Image preview. Nothing Java doesn't provide already, in the interest of keeping things simple.


### Name
The name is a tribute to other file managers that have "Commander" somewhere in their titles. It came to me after
thinking about contracting _file explorer_ and somehow adding a _J_ for Java in there. The _e_ for _enabled_ is
something that I had to come up with to justify the letter.


### Why
I am absolutely appalled by the Nautilus browser in the Gnome flavor that comes with Debian 8. That thing is an
insult to the user, power and novice alike. While I was looking for a replacement a thought came to me, which
no programmer is unfamiliar with: _I'll make my own damn $(piece of software)_. And here we are.
